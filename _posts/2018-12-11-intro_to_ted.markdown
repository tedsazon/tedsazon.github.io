2018 was the cliche "rollercoaster" year for me. I've been to the mountain top (got married woohoo!). I've seen the heavens (got my dream job yahooo!). With all that I have also been to the bottom. This past May was  a month of great pain and sorrow for the old Tedster. Getting let go is never fun.

However, my loss has shown me that when you exit one door, it can lead to many doors, windows, hatches, rabbit-holes etc. 

For the past 10 years, I've been neck deep in t-shirts, hoodies, sweatpants, jackets, vests , sneakers, blah, blah. If there is one thing to learn from the streetwear fashion industry, it's that the trends may change, but the people don't. It became a grand chase of what's the next big thing, where one thing remains dynamic, and another lays static. I was too busy searching for the newest brands to realize that I myself never improved on anything. It was the same thing, over and over, for that past 10 years.

Losing my job killed me. Losing my job also transformed me. 

I started thinking of alternate routes I could have taken in my life. Not a regret thing, just an alternate timeline. I came to the conclusion that I would not change a thing. The things I've learned, the people I've met, it's all a part of the journey. With this way of thinking, I still thought of the alternate timeline. It wasn't too late for me. 

I'm not really sure how I decided to get into coding, but it just made sense. Coding is everything, and coding is everywhere. I think that's what really hooked me in. The ability to impact the world with lines of code. I wanted that.
